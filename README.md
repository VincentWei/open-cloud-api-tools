# Tools for Open Cloud API

This is a sub-project of Open Cloud API project. We release tools such as crawlers for fetching data from Internet.

We are also releasing Tools for Open Cloud API under Apache License 2.0.

Open Cloud API is an open source project which tries to provide free APIs for internet apps to fetch public structured data (such as country list) or some common computing services (such as generating QR code).

## Usage

If you want to commit the data generated by the tools into the MySQL database
for your Open Cloud API installation, you should create a pvDbConfig.py file
and speicify the options to connect to your MySQL instance:

	# encoding: utf-8
	host='ldb'
	name='fsen_dev'
	user='fsen_dev'
	passwd='XXXX'
